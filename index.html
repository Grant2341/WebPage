      <p>A new five-inch full-color TFT display provides the rider with the option of five different themes, including the SP-specific TRACK theme, 
         to suit different riding situations or individual preference. The new display is navigated through all-new integrated handlebar switches. Button shape and feel 
         have been extensively refined to provide intuitive operation in a compact, easy-to-use solution.
